Hi, I’m Davide.

**Check out my programmer's portfolio [✨here✨](https://dpasca.github.io/portfolio/)**

I consider programming computers the ultimate form of exploration and creativity, everything else is secondary.
I'm an R&D guy at the core, although I also appreciate publishing products, because it's something that can have a direct impact on people.

My current main interest is in **AI**, both at the low-level (**C++, PyTorch**) and higher level (**Python, LLM APIs, prompt engineering***).
My interested in AI and machine-learning started in 2018, when I began developing *ENZO*, an **algorithmic trading** system for cryptocurrencies.
Previous to that, I spent 20 years working in **game development** and **3D graphics**, working both for large game companies and my own dev studio.

- I sometimes post videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidePasca)

I'm very passionate about technology development and programming. I spent most of my career writing C++ code, although for the past year I've been using Python more and more, for the sake of AI R&D.

Italian is my mother tongue, English second, Japanese a distant third. I've been studying Russian and Chinese very lazily... some day something will come out of it.
