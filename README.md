Hi, I’m Davide.

**Check out my programmer's portfolio [✨here✨](https://dpasca.github.io/portfolio/)**

I consider programming computers the ultimate form of exploration and creativity, everything else is secondary.
I'm an R&D guy at the core, although I also appreciate publishing products, because it's something that can have a direct impact on people.

I've been developing software and video games since the 90s, always with a focus in low level programming, 3D graphics and game engine development. Since 2018 I've been working mostly on algorithmic trading. This recent endeavor lead to the creation of [ENZO-TS](https://www.enzobot.com), a complete trading system for cryptocurrencies.

- I have a blog where I write about my deeper thoughts (!) at [xpsvr.com](https://xpsvr.com)
- My algo trading stuff at [www.enzobot.com](https://www.enzobot.com)
- My mobile games at [oykgames.com](https://oykgames.com)
- I sometimes post videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidePasca)

I have no hobbies other than programming. I'm not a big fan of languages, either for human or computer, nevertheless..
- My favorite programming language is C++, for better or for worse.
- Italian is my mother tongue, English second, Japanese a distant third.
- In 2022 I started learning Russian and Chinese on Duolingo ([my profile](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/TheCrib)).
