Programming represents the pinnacle of exploration and creativity for me. I'm deeply involved in R&D, constantly pursuing innovative ideas and technologies. In the years I also found significant satisfaction in developing impactful software, particularly in the realms of gaming and interactive media, used and enjoyed by millions worldwide.

My native language is Italian 🇮🇹, I'm fluent in English 🇺🇸, decent in Japanese 🇯🇵, and I can catch some words in Russian 🇷🇺 and Chinese 🇨🇳.

## Career
My current focus lies in [AI Research & Development](https://newtypekk.com/#ai-research), working both at the low level with **C++**, **Python**, and **PyTorch**, and at the higher level with LLMs, **OpenAI's API** and **agent-based architectures**.

I've successfully applied **AI / ML** to:
- Automated crypto trading: [ENZO-TS](https://dpasca.github.io/portfolio/#enzo-trading-system)
- Simple autopilot logic for airframes: [XPSVR](https://dpasca.github.io/portfolio/#xpsvr-experimental-flight-simulator)
- Virtual assistants with fact-checking and RAG: [ChatAI](https://github.com/dpasca/ChatAI)
- Video games: [RogueLLM](https://github.com/dpasca/roguellm)

Prior to AI, I dedicated over two decades to **game development** and **real-time 3D graphics**, gaining experience in major gaming corporations as well as spearheading projects at my own [development studio](https://oykgames.com).

## A programmer in 2024 ?

I'm not a terribly nostalgic person, and while I do appreciate how programming used to be, I very much welcomed the benefits recently brought by AI tools such as *ChatGPT* and *Copilot*. I've always wished for more time and more brain power to explore and implement many ideas that I had, and these tools are a giant leap in that direction.

I believe this to be a new golden age for engineers. Modern LLMs are incredibly powerful. A major focus of my research is to extract the most from them, from the perspective of a software engineer.
