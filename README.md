Hi, I’m Davide.

I consider programming computers the ultimate form of exploration and creativity, everything else is secondary.
I'm an R&D guy at the core, although I also appreciate publishing products, something that can have a direct impact on people.

I've been developings software and video games since the 90s, always with a focus in low level programming, 3D graphics and game engine development. Since 2018 I've been working mostly on algorithmic trading, for which I developed a complete trading system.

- I have a blog where I write about my deeper thoughts (!): https://xpsvr.com
- My algo trading stuff: https://www.enzobot.com
- My mobile games: https://oykgames.com
- I sometimes post videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidePasca

I have no hobbies other than programming. I'm not a fan of languages, either human of computer, nevertheless..
- My favorite programming language is C++, for better or for worse.
- Italian is my mother tongue, English second, Japanese a distant third.
- I recently started learning Russian and Chinese on Duolingo, see https://www.duolingo.com/profile/TheCrib.
