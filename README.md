Hi, I’m Davide.

Programming represents the pinnacle of exploration and creativity for me. I'm deeply involved in R&D, constantly pursuing innovative ideas and technologies. In the years I also found significant satisfaction in developing impactful software, particularly in the realms of gaming and interactive media, used and enjoyed by millions worldwide.

My native language is Italian 🇮🇹, I'm fluent in English 🇺🇸, decent in Japanese 🇯🇵, and I can catch some words in Russian 🇷🇺 and Chinese 🇨🇳.

## Career

My current focus lies in AI, balancing between the detailed intricacies of **C++**, **Python**, and **PyTorch** at a low level, and the strategic implementation of high-level API interfaces such as OpenAI's API.

My journey into AI and machine-learning began in 2017 working on the [XPSVR flight sim](https://dpasca.github.io/portfolio/#xpsvr-experimental-flight-simulator), progressing with the development of [ENZO-TS](https://www.enzobot.com), an **algorithmic trading** system for cryptocurrencies.

[Here](https://github.com/topics/ai?q=user:dpasca) is a list of AI-related projects and experiments I've released as Open Source.

Prior to this, I dedicated over two decades to **game development** and **real-time 3D graphics**, gaining experience in major gaming corporations as well as spearheading projects at my own [development studio](https://oykgames.com).

## A programmer in 2024

I'm not a terribly nostalgic person, and while I do appreciate how programming used to be, I very much welcomed the benefits recently brought by AI tools such as *ChatGPT* and *Copilot*. I've always wished for more time and more brain power to explore and implement many ideas that I had, and these tools are a giant leap in that direction.

I believe (hope ?) that as much as an equalizer these AI tools are, they will continue to work as a force multiplier, expecially for those of us that have extensive experience in software engineering.
